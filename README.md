## About me

  My name is Matheus, and I have a degree in Mechanics: Welding Processes. I am passionate about solving problems and finding innovative ways to improve different processes. Over time, I developed my skills as a FullStack Developer, applying my knowledge to real-world situations, working on projects, and delivering solutions that are actively used. Oh, and I like games!
